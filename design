Theme: Here at the end


Idea: post apoclaptic farming

Start in a small area surrounded by ruins & flames
Grow plants that provide resources to push back the fire, get over obstacles, expand your overall territory

find single plants, use their seeds to grow more of the same kind

something like raft or a factory game


What kinds of problems need to be solved??
  put out fires
  water for other plants
  get over obstacles
  protect other plants
  regenerate health
  create usable plots for other plants?
    steps to making plantable plot:
      put out fires around
      clear debris off ground
      dig hole/plow
      plant nutrient sowing plant
      remove nutrient sowing plant after it's fully grown
      dig hole/plow again

  put out plants that catch fire
  watch out for fire birds in the sky


plants:
  plant that produces water blobs (how does that work? hand wave for now)
  plant with platforms to climb on
  water launcher plant
  healing fruit plant
  wall plant (block embers from others)
  alarm plant?



adversaries:
  hopping ember thingy
  fire spread
  fire birds
  plants get old and wither?
